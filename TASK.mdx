Smak CLI is a command line tool for easier git cli interaction.

## Command list

# `smak b`
- user can navigate through branches using arrow keys
- user can select a branch using enter
- user can select multiple branches using `d` button. selected branch names should be displayed with red color. after if user clicks `enter` button,
cli should ask for branch deletion confirmation (Y/N). If user clicks `Y` button, cli should delete selected branches. If user clicks `N` button,
cli should not delete any branches and leave the user in the same screen with selected branches for deletion.
- branches should be sorted by last commit date
- branch item in list should contain branch name, last commit date and last commit message
- branch item in list should contain number of commits in origin that are not in the local repository
- branch item in list should contain number of commits in local repository that are not in the origin

# `smak help`
- user can see list of commands with descriptions

# `smak c`
- user can see list of commits in the current branch
- user can navigate through commits using arrow keys
- user can select a commit using enter, after that full commit message with full hash should be displayed in the terminal at the top with proper formatting + git diff
should be displayed below the commit message, by which user can navigate through diffs using arrow keys. If user clicks `escape` button return to the previous screen.

## Addition requirements
- use bubletea for terminal ui
- use cobra for command line parsing
- each command that supports additional manipulation, for example `escape` to return to the previous screen, or `d` to select for deletion, should have
a help panel on the bottom of the screen with short description.
- i want be able to install this cli as a global command, so i can use it from any directory, add ability to it and guide. it should follow standards of other cli tools written
in Go installation.
